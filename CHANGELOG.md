## [Unreleased]

## [2026-02-25]

### Added

- Security remediation roadmap for OAK codebase — comprehensive review of security and correctness issues across the codebase produced a phased, prioritized remediation plan organized by severity tier — [Plan OAK codebase security remediation tiers](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/4f174509-2169-434d-995f-7b69d12d64e6)

## [2026-02-24]

### Added

- Dynamic focus switching for Oak ACP agent templates — users can now switch a running ACP agent's focus to one of four specialized templates (documentation, analysis, engineering, maintenance) via session configuration, enabling context-appropriate assistance without restarting the agent — [Implement dynamic focus switching for Oak ACP agent templates](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/d4572ed6-0f54-4b7e-8b5d-14099119049d), [Implement focus transition logic for Oak ACP agent templates](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/e7747ce2-d140-4a5b-991f-b4ad7e79e85a)
- Full CI integration for ACP interactive sessions — ACP sessions now trigger Oak tool-usage hooks and generate session summaries, replacing the thin Claude wrapper with a fully OAK-intelligent experience that participates in codebase intelligence like any native session — [Implement tool usage hooks and session summaries for ACP flow](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/e16dc2e4-3cb1-4c25-b54f-ed722a9e9fea)
- "Oak" agent type filter on session activity page — a new filter option lets users isolate sessions originating from the Oak ACP agent, completing end-to-end visibility of the ACP interactive session flow in the daemon UI — [Add Oak agent filter option to session activity page](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/32c76bb7-885d-4d4e-ade3-ea5a76a563ee)
- Automated smoke-test for ACP daemon architecture — HTTP-based smoke-test exercises the running daemon end-to-end including session creation, tool delegation, and activity recording; also unifies agent naming to `oak` across the ACP module and removes leftover scaffolding artifacts — [Implement automated smoke‑test for oak daemon and clean up artifacts](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/6071a39b-3982-425d-aa1e-47a4159dec6d)

### Changed

- Upgrade command now launches in a detached subprocess from daemon UI — a new helper spawns `oak upgrade` as a detached process so the daemon UI remains responsive during upgrades rather than blocking on the CLI subprocess — [Implement detached upgrade command helper for daemon UI](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/e5c82db0-6d2b-4881-8c8c-c28ae1eea7ea)

### Fixed

- Fix `daemon_client.py` path construction causing `FileNotFoundError` — `discover_daemon` used an unresolved relative `rel_path` when locating the daemon port file; now resolves the full path via `Path(project_root).resolve() / rel_path` and returns `None` gracefully when the file is absent — [Implement automated smoke‑test for oak daemon and clean up artifacts](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/6071a39b-3982-425d-aa1e-47a4159dec6d)
- Fix `_run_upgrade_pipeline` type errors in `restart.py` — `Path` type was not imported and the `run_in_executor` call passed a plain `dict` instead of the required `UpgradePlan` instance; both corrected to resolve Ruff static-analysis errors and prevent runtime type mismatches — [Implement detached upgrade command helper for daemon UI](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/e5c82db0-6d2b-4881-8c8c-c28ae1eea7ea)
- Fix activity route registration typo and missing authentication — `@router.ge` decorator typo prevented the endpoint from registering with FastAPI, and activity routes lacked the shared `Authorization` header dependency used elsewhere in the daemon — [Implement tool usage hooks and session summaries for ACP flow](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/e16dc2e4-3cb1-4c25-b54f-ed722a9e9fea)

### Notes

> **Gotcha**: ACP focus switching injects a system-prompt override at session-config time. Mid-conversation agents will not retroactively reinterpret earlier messages under the new template — focus changes take effect on the next message boundary only.

> **Gotcha**: The ACP smoke-test expects the daemon's activity store directory (`~/.oak/activity_store`) to exist and be writable before tests run. If the smoke-test exits with code 1, verify the directory exists with correct permissions and that `daemon/config.py` points to that path.

## [2026-02-23]

### Added

- ACP (Agent Client Protocol) server for editor integration — OAK can now act as a first-class coding agent that editors communicate with via the ACP pipe; a dedicated `acp_server` feature module exposes agents over ACP with a non-blocking async stdin reader, `AgentSideConnection` wrapper, and Typer-based `serve` CLI command — [Add ACP SDK dependency and constants module for OAK Agent](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/1d6517aa-70fd-4b21-9f57-9f648356c86c), [Implement daemon‑delegation architecture for OAK ACP server and session manager](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/f70f69e8-672c-4260-9d9e-a31f120c2610), [Implement session manager integration with daemon‑delegation architecture](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/3318476c-99cc-4b8b-8fd7-287346104240)
- ACP integrations UI — new `ACPIntegrations` component in the daemon UI shows per-editor integration cards (Zed, etc.) with enable/disable toggles; configuration is rendered from the ACP JSON schema and reloads CLI config on mount to stay in sync with backend — [Implement daemon‑delegation architecture for OAK ACP server and session manager](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/f70f69e8-672c-4260-9d9e-a31f120c2610)

### Changed

- Upgrade banner prompt text made more descriptive — the UI now displays a clearer label when an automatic update is detected and ready to apply, replacing the previous terse restart prompt — [Update Upgrade Prompt Text with Descriptive Label](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/864f4d39-ac4d-4a36-b882-c68bb5600863)

### Fixed

- Fix `ModuleNotFoundError` for `acp` package in tests — a lightweight local stub providing the minimal `acp` API surface (`start_tool_call`, `text_block`, `update_age`) was added to the repository and declared in `pyproject.toml`, removing the undeclared external dependency that broke the test suite — [Implement daemon‑delegation architecture for OAK ACP server and session manager](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/f70f69e8-672c-4260-9d9e-a31f120c2610)
- Fix SQL syntax errors in `plan_detector.py` — escaped inequality operator (`\!=`) and reference to non-existent `timestamp_epoch` column caused SQLite parse failures; replaced with standard `!=` and the correct `created_at` column — [Implement daemon‑delegation architecture for OAK ACP server and session manager](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/f70f69e8-672c-4260-9d9e-a31f120c2610)

### Notes

> **Note**: The ACP server is shipped as an optional dependency (`acp` extra in `pyproject.toml`). The core OAK distribution remains lightweight; install with `pip install open-agent-kit[acp]` to enable editor ACP integration.

> **Gotcha**: The `acp` package must be installed in the same virtual environment as OAK. If the daemon raises `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'acp'` at startup, verify the package is present (`pip show acp`) and that the daemon is running from the correct environment.

> **Gotcha**: The `ACPIntegrations` component context provider (`AcpIntegrationContext`) is created and consumed within the same file and is not exported. Composing ACP integration state into other UI pages requires either lifting state to a shared context or extending the export surface.

## [2026-02-22]

### Added

- Git worktree support — Oak hooks, daemon lookup, and repo-root resolution now work correctly inside `git worktree` checkouts; a dedicated `WorktreeManager` class wraps Git subprocess calls and maintains an in-memory registry of active worktrees — [Add shell guard to OAK hook templates and enable worktree support](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/836996b7-6a5a-4ffc-accd-b63fdd23eda6), [Implement smoke‑test harness for OAK worktree initialization](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/5bc4e8b6-932e-4264-8782-d3271a275cf9)
- Team Member filter on session activity page — replaces the Machine filter with a member-based grouping that treats all sessions from the same user as one group regardless of machine; `source_machine_id` and `plan_count` fields added to the `SessionItem` model to support the new display — [Add source_machine_id and plan_count to SessionItem model](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/a9f6e105-1c7e-4175-8d6e-6d3a86c7e397), [Update session activity filter to display by team member](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/45633407-b3dd-4eb5-950d-3bce0dfbe622), [Update session activity page with Team Member filter and badge logic](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/358ad3f1-460a-4d10-876d-905c287ac51f)
- Swift language support via Treesitter parser — adds a Treesitter-based parser for Swift and refactors config to allow Oak to reliably search Swift codebases — [Add Treesitter parser for Swift and refactor config](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/b9271ccb-13f3-4d00-947b-bf010ba73060)

### Changed

- Upgrade banner now reads the CLI command name from runtime config (`config.command_alias`) instead of the hard-coded `"oak"` constant, so users running a custom alias (e.g., `oak-dev`) see the correct command in the banner — [Configure daemon banner to use command from config](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/2dc0d4c0-fffa-4cfd-bec3-3e19547668d3)
- Project Governance skill updated to focus on amending existing constitutions, with RFC/ADR generation demoted to an optional step rather than the default output — [Update Project Governance Skill to Optional RFC Generation](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/6e7db7a6-14c4-438c-ba24-6f1b311207da)

### Fixed

- Fix `resolve_main_repo_root()` failing inside git worktrees — `.git` is a file (not a directory) in worktrees; the function now detects this, reads the target path, and resolves the root correctly — [Add shell guard to OAK hook templates and enable worktree support](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/836996b7-6a5a-4ffc-accd-b63fdd23eda6)
- Fix upgrade banner persisting after daemon restart — `use-status` hook cached the running version in localStorage; cleared on restart so the banner reflects the actual running version — [Configure daemon banner to use command from config](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/2dc0d4c0-fffa-4cfd-bec3-3e19547668d3)

### Notes

> **Gotcha**: `resolve_main_repo_root()` previously assumed `.git` was a directory. Inside a worktree it is a plain file containing `gitdir: <path>`. Any code that calls this helper must be tested in both regular checkout and worktree contexts; imports also require the repository root on `PYTHONPATH` since worktrees do not automatically inherit the parent repo's module search path.

> **Gotcha**: The Team Member filter groups sessions by user identity, not by machine. If two developers share the same Git username the filter will merge their sessions into one group. The machine-level `source_machine_id` field is still available in the `SessionItem` payload for tooling that needs it.

> **Gotcha**: The upgrade banner's hard-coded `UI_COMMAND` constant caused it to show `"oak"` even when users ran `"oak-dev"` or another alias. After the fix the banner reads `config.command_alias` at render time — ensure the daemon is restarted after changing your CLI alias so the config propagates.

## [2026-02-21]

### Added

- Documentation agent prioritizes newer Python versions — root-docs agent now selects the latest available Python interpreter when generating documentation, improving output quality for Python-version-sensitive content — [Refactor documentation agent to prioritize newer Python versions](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/993e6f41-a448-41a0-9a55-4a1ce3087239)

### Fixed

- Fix `ci_project_stats` always reporting zero unique files and zero memory count — `get_stats()` was missing `unique_files` and `memory_count` keys in its return dict; `count_unique_files` also skipped counting when commits had no files. Both fixed in `management.py` and `operations.py` — [Fix CI projects stats agent project count bug](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/624df25e-b64c-4a68-b6fd-3a7e14ed6dbf)
- Fix hover styles disappearing on navigation bar components — Tailwind `group-hover` utilities were not triggering because parent elements were missing the `group` class after a recent refactor — [Debug missing hover styles in navigation bar components](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/269ecaf8-1da1-4585-84ce-0d18564ca5b1)
- Fix governance plugin error caused by missing or misconfigured Oak governance settings — security guidance plugin hook was loading unconditionally at startup and failing when governance was not enabled in the target project — [Configure Oak governance settings to fix plugin error](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/bf77c105-152a-4e42-80fc-f191926bea52)

### Notes

> **Gotcha**: The Tailwind `group-hover` utility requires the parent element to carry the `group` class. Navigation components that lost this class during a refactor will silently drop all hover effects — check the rendered DOM if hover styles stop working after restructuring layout components.

> **Gotcha**: The security guidance plugin registers its hook via `hooks.json` and loads unconditionally at agent startup, regardless of whether governance is enabled in the host project. Projects without Oak governance configured will see a runtime error. Set `governance.enabled: false` in the project's Oak config, or ensure the plugin is only installed in governed projects.

## [2026-02-19/20]

### Added

- Brain Maintenance Agent with writable CI tools — autonomous agent that periodically cleans OAK's memory store: deduplicates observations, archives superseded ones, synthesizes cross-session insights, and emits structured health reports to `oak/insights/data-hygiene.jsonl` and `brain-maintenance-decisions.jsonl`. Includes a `memory_write` flag gating write access and a `memory-consolidation.yaml` task for orchestrated cleanup workflows — [Implement Brain Maintenance Agent with Writable CI Tools](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/08bea3d4-7ae7-421a-b8fc-a724f3c111f8), [Implement Brain Maintenance Agent system prompt and memory_write flag](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/0a9179bf-cdf6-4d19-98c8-2201d6d3c09b)

- Cloud Relay HTTP streaming configuration — [Implement Cloud Relay HTTP streaming configuration](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/4ebcd98d-d628-4c88-b332-c4c7ec8009ac)
- Agent Governance sub-module with observability and optional enforcement — hook-level evaluation of tool calls against configurable rules (e.g., `no-destructive-bash`), audit event logging with session correlation, and deny-mode blocking for high-risk operations. Governance events are now included in team backup/restore for cross-machine consistency — [Implement CI governance sub-module with deny mechanism](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/6b834bea-d704-4c79-8657-8f4df1ee5292), [Add governance audit events to backup system](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/7858b8e5-204a-4366-a103-b7a78d108fb0)
- Session summary dedicated column — summaries migrated from `memory_observations` to `sessions.summary` column (schema v5→v6), improving query performance and eliminating duplicate embeddings in semantic search. Backup restore now backfills summaries from legacy observation format — [Migrate session summaries to dedicated column](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/81153f0c-1729-4fc8-a8ad-6a4d9b743311), [Fix session summary migration and display issues](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/d742f4d7-7007-494d-9229-dec8979b12f6)

- Cloud MCP Relay with one-click Cloudflare Workers deployment — enables remote MCP server access via WebSocket proxy with automatic worker scaffolding, Wrangler deployment, and in-browser connection status UI — [Implement Cloud MCP Relay with WebSocket proxy on Cloudflare Workers](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/442283b6-636c-4994-ad57-6bc941eba4b1), [Implement one-click Cloud MCP Relay deployment](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/31ca132b-7ce8-4494-995f-b8431d7196b5)
- Automated custom domain provisioning for Cloud Relay — users can now specify a base domain and Oak automatically generates a subdomain, configures `wrangler.toml` with a `[[routes]]` section, and lets Cloudflare handle DNS and SSL provisioning during deployment (domain zone must be in user's Cloudflare account) — [Implement automated custom domain provisioning for Cloud MCP Relay](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/6f574be5-0ab0-40cc-b90f-db430cbf566c), [Implement automated custom domain provisioning with Cloudflare](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/70337198-b5cb-44a4-ba4b-7166dc85622c)
- Dynamic session summarization with multi-model support — summaries now adapt to different model providers (Ollama, LM Studio, cloud APIs) with defensive JSON unwrapping to handle context window truncation — [Implement dynamic session summarization for multiple models](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/ecd780e8-5f8f-4e0e-a69e-61ecc8cabb19)

- Power state aware daemon behavior — daemon now scales background processing based on system activity with four states: ACTIVE (full processing), IDLE (maintenance only), SLEEP (minimal I/O), and DEEP_SLEEP (paused). This reduces resource consumption when the user stops coding, allowing macOS to enter proper sleep states. Background tasks like SQLite queries and backups now respect power state transitions — [Implement power state aware daemon behavior](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/01735ec6-438a-4950-8a57-4c630f170b24), [Debug idle resource consumption issue](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/618dc82e-46a4-48c3-b3a3-fcab14f5ffd5)
- Observation lifecycle management — observations now track status (`active`, `resolved`, `superseded`) with session-type awareness (`planning`, `investigation`, `implementation`, `mixed`), enabling agents to distinguish current knowledge from historical context and filter stale observations from context windows — [Implement observation lifecycle management system](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/cc6d1209-222c-4d32-9420-011876a7ee61)
- Personalized session summaries — LLM-generated summaries now use Git/GitHub usernames instead of generic "the user" references, improving searchability and attribution — [Fix date filtering and user identity issues in session summaries](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/49e246b5-ded7-483d-abc9-7de56e780caf)
- Memory-observation lineage tracking — observations now link back to their source memory, enabling bidirectional navigation between memories and the observations that created them — [Add memory-observation lineage support across codebase intelligence](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/fd23376c-0545-4a31-a433-1a2a5cdfb620)
- Session ID metadata for embedding search — summaries and memories now include `session_id` in embedding metadata, enabling filtered searches scoped to specific sessions — [Add session_id metadata for searchable summaries and memories](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/f6fd6830-e260-4603-bc29-41178a7da9b6), [Add sessionId to embedding metadata and database](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/4d46f5a6-a2dd-4e13-ae89-19d5c0b07c0d)
- Inline plan detection via response patterns — plans are now detected heuristically from assistant responses when explicit plan hooks are not available, improving plan capture coverage for agents without native plan support — [Add inline plan detection via response patterns](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/df16233a-9114-4b6e-a4e2-420e62cd2b47)
- Daemon version mismatch detection and restart UI — when the `oak` CLI is upgraded, the daemon now detects the version difference via a background check (every 60s), displays a banner in the web UI, and offers a one-click "Restart Daemon" button, eliminating manual `oak ci restart` calls — [Implement daemon version mismatch detection and restart UI](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/39e12dc7-e79a-40cf-bde2-b74442528f69)
- Self-healing stale installation check — daemon now detects when its package installation becomes stale (e.g., after `uv tool install` overwrites an editable install) and surfaces a warning in the UI, preventing silent failures from misaligned package paths — [Add self‑healing stale installation check to daemon](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/1b7f1e8f-2d46-46dc-9cdf-e987cceea56b)
- Self-healing daemon restart logic with watchdog — daemon now automatically restarts after detecting critical failures, with a watchdog process ensuring recovery from crashes — [Implement self‑healing daemon restart logic and watchdog](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/2041b3c1-c572-43e9-8c5b-adb79fd41ade)
- Project name displayed in daemon UI browser tab title for better multi-project disambiguation — [Add project name to daemon UI tab title](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/6f305703-4383-4f41-8bba-cafa08c2f0e3)
- Local-only hook configuration for all AI agents — hook files are now kept out of version control via `.gitignore` entries and `.local.json` variants, so contributors who clone a repo without Oak installed see no hook errors. A `hooks-local-only` migration applies the change on upgrade — [Configure local‑only GitHub hooks for Oak‑enabled agents](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/031fde6b-6250-4dc1-b705-52c454b75271)

### Changed

- Agent prompts and model configurations standardized across the agent system — analysis task prompts now follow a consistent structure and model assignments are explicit, reducing ambiguity during task dispatch — [Refactor and standardize agent prompts and model configurations](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/f0cc98ec-9cb9-4d2b-850c-d244edd102da)
- Team backups page UI layout and messaging updated for clarity — [Update team backups page UI layout and messaging](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/c069d146-1c7f-4fd5-9dc5-b81ecdfb8851)

- Obsolete `backend-python-expert` command removed from codebase intelligence feature — dead code cleanup reduces maintenance burden and clarifies the CLI surface — [Remove obsolete backend python expert command from codebase intelligence feature](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/2f76aa42-307c-41dc-89c8-fdfc899d9a56), [Remove obsolete backend-python-expert command](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/ebe33ad5-8ead-4bd4-8e49-dfd7795598d6)
- DevTools database operations refactored to use store layer — maintenance operations (VACUUM, orphan cleanup) now route through the unified store abstraction instead of raw SQL, improving consistency and testability — [Refactor devtools to use store layer for database operations](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/831215be-658e-430c-9077-3fc9e3937441)
- License updated to 2025-2026 date range with business name as copyright holder — [Update license copyright year and holder name](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/d01d958e-e24e-4f1a-a611-91e67f06aeba)
- Batch processing performance improved — batch sizes increased from 10 to 50 items per cycle with parallel processing, significantly reducing memory processing time — [Optimize batch processing and database performance](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/e54fa8e6-6ce9-4141-91e3-8ca5ca51c3dc)
- Codebase refactored into six parallel build streams for independent testing — core, daemon, indexing, memory, activity, and agents can now be tested and validated separately, reducing CI time and enabling targeted development — [Refactor OAK codebase into six parallel build streams for independent testing](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/cebab386-ae4e-4327-8840-15976114029b), [Refactor OAK codebase into six parallel work streams](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/666ef8df-666b-482b-a36b-44fa9d63826e)
- Built-in agent task YAMLs no longer copied into `oak/agents/` during installation — the registry now loads built-ins directly from the package, reducing installation footprint and preventing accidental overwrites of user customizations. A cleanup migration removes existing copies on upgrade — [Remove built‑in agent task copies and add cleanup migration](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/ea8917a0-aebb-4616-be07-14b5e7843e56), [Refactor installation to remove built‑in agent task copies](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/12a1a982-0d3a-401b-b9d0-d38083fafa85)
- `generate_schema_ref.py` relocated from installed skill directory to `src/open_agent_kit/features/codebase_intelligence/scripts/`, keeping the build-time script out of agent skill payloads and reducing installed footprint — [Refactor schema generation script placement to feature source tree](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/f0e6bfbe-cee4-431c-848b-10ad9929adb8), [Refactor generate_schema_ref.py relocation to centralized scripts folder](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/9e9f814a-1a6b-49ab-a299-ee6632f5b6e0)
- Hooks-reference documentation cleaned for end-user focus — removed Oak contributor sections and added a "not" section to clarify feature boundaries — [Update documentation with Oak‑not section and clean hooks reference](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/d46e5c83-ff36-4eea-a77c-ba8bbf9cb74d)

### Fixed

- Fix `ci_project_stats` always reporting zero unique files and zero memory count — `get_stats()` was missing `unique_files` and `memory_count` keys in its return dict; `count_unique_files` also skipped counting when commits had no files. Both fixed in `management.py` and `operations.py` — [Fix CI projects stats agent project count bug](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/624df25e-b64c-4a68-b6fd-3a7e14ed6dbf)
- Fix critical executor bug in `_get_effective_execution()` causing incorrect task dispatch — standardized analysis task prompts as part of the same cleanup — [Fix critical executor bug and standardize analysis task prompts](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/9d1000d5-8b9f-4c06-9245-6aaf889616a2)

- Fix session lineage auto-linking after plan execution — child sessions now correctly link to parent when executing a plan, resolving orphaned session chains — [Fix session lineage auto-linking in Claude Code](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/d63793ec-bfac-4c6c-9230-90247badecd5)
- Fix Cursor plan capture detection — plan files created by Cursor are now properly detected and linked to sessions in the codebase intelligence system — [Fix Cursor plan capture detection in codebase intelligence](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/6e8cc386-a148-41a3-9c15-bc0d2bf75774)
- Fix governance hook event casing mismatch — `HOOK_EVENT_PRE_TOOL_USE` constant was kebab-case (`pre-tool-use`) but Claude Code sends PascalCase (`PreToolUse`), causing deny responses to never apply. Now normalizes both sides for comparison — [Implement CI governance sub-module with deny mechanism](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/6b834bea-d704-4c79-8657-8f4df1ee5292)
- Fix CLI help text listing `rfc` as a primary command when it's agent-only — help output now accurately reflects the command hierarchy with `oak ci` as the primary CI entrypoint — [Fix CLI help text accuracy and command separation](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/070bd34e-f98a-4ae7-96d0-62a259bd143d)
- Fix MCP server plan resolution and tool call handling — plans now show resolved state correctly during polling, and tool call descriptions are clearer for debugging — [Fix plan resolution and tool call handling in MCP server](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/399c6996-ffc6-4e91-b8fc-e07ca3639517)
- Fix "today" filter showing incorrect results due to timezone mismatch — date filtering now correctly handles timezone differences between server and client — [Fix date filtering and user identity issues in session summaries](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/49e246b5-ded7-483d-abc9-7de56e780caf)
- Fix VS Code Copilot hook crashes — centralized hook formatting and fixed schema validation errors that caused the Copilot integration to crash after recent refactors — [Fix VS Code Copilot crash by centralizing hook formatting](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/94f771fb-3afd-41f0-80d5-dbf739a0b146), [Fix VS Code Copilot schema crash after refactor](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/d6d3ab1f-2f9f-4b7b-9660-319397875362), [Fix undefined hook error in VS Code Co‑Pilot integration](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/70d43b82-ebfc-4f1f-aeb4-04a2e0890983)
- Fix early migration order to refresh agent list — migrations now run in correct order to ensure the agent list is refreshed before the upgrade pipeline processes it — [Fix early migration order to refresh agent list for upgrade pipeline](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/ef95084c-ad6b-4c97-9c4e-9d316b0dd9dd)
- Fix Oak daemon upgrade error handling — raw error messages are now hidden from users during upgrades, replaced with user-friendly messaging — [Fix Oak daemon upgrade error handling to hide raw errors](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/601316fd-3367-4a83-b12d-3f5b9a4f0953)
- Fix "Compact All" button leaving ChromaDB in locked state — the button now triggers a daemon restart after deleting the collection, ensuring the database is cleanly reopened in a fresh process context without manual intervention — [Fix Compact All button to restart daemon after deletion](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/de86fb00-f151-47b2-bbd4-43173fde5a07)
- Fix session summary title generation failing for non-reasoning models — the title extraction regex now handles models that don't emit chain-of-thought reasoning, preventing empty or malformed titles — [Fix session summary title generation for non‑reasoning models](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/67ff7cbb-5a62-4c90-af40-9057eb2111a3)
- Fix environment and dependency resolution issues affecting Agents SDK and Oak CLI installations — improved path handling and dependency isolation to prevent conflicts between editable installs and tool installs — [Fix environment and dependency issues for agents SDK and Oak CLI](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/9ad12915-99d4-4e32-8d55-902fa35c56d9)
- Fix Homebrew tap build failures and update installation documentation to reflect `brew install goondocks-co/oak/oak-ci` as the recommended macOS install method — [Fix Homebrew tap and update Oak CI installation docs](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/45cd3a6f-2589-440c-afa3-97fbf337a8a7)
- Fix daemon self-restart failing after Homebrew upgrade — `sys.executable` pointed to the old deleted Cellar path, causing `FileNotFoundError`. Now uses `/bin/sh -c "sleep N && oak ci restart"` which always resolves to the current version on `$PATH` — [Implement daemon version mismatch detection and recovery](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/2b06d520-1f5e-455a-9dd8-84f14348d627)
- Fix Homebrew formula PyPI CDN propagation race condition — `brew install` could fail if the PyPI simple index hadn't propagated the new version yet. Formula `post_install` now retries `pip install` 5 times with 30s backoff, and the tap workflow uses `pip download --no-deps` with 20 retries over 10 minutes — [Fix Homebrew tap and update Oak CI installation docs](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/45cd3a6f-2589-440c-afa3-97fbf337a8a7)
- Fix session auto-linking selecting stale parent — `find_linkable_parent_session` now filters by project ID and returns the most recent eligible session, preventing child sessions from linking to unrelated older sessions across projects
- Fix Cloud Relay page losing custom domain on refresh — the `/api/cloud/status` endpoint now includes `custom_domain` in its payload so the UI consistently uses the saved domain after page reload
- Fix Cloud Relay spurious error toast on WebSocket connect — the `onError` handler now only sets error state when the event payload contains an actual error message, suppressing false toasts on normal connection establishment
- Fix `plan_detector.py` default argument causing `FileNotFoundError` — `known_plan_file_path` now defaults to an empty string with a guard that skips file I/O on empty input, preventing test-suite failures
- Fix Cloud Relay worker deployment missing `wrangler.jsonc` — scaffolding now generates a minimal `wrangler.jsonc` with worker name, compatibility date, and main script path so `npx wrangler deploy` can locate the entry point automatically

### Notes

> **Note**: The Brain Maintenance Agent uses a `memory_write` flag to gate write access to the memory store. Without this flag set, the agent runs in read-only/analysis mode. Health reports persist to `oak/insights/` as JSONL files so they survive daemon restarts and can be queried without a database.

> **Gotcha**: The `ci_project_stats` tool reported 0 unique files when any commit had an empty file list — the old `if not commit.files: continue` guard prevented counting files from other commits. After the fix, counts are aggregated across all commits using a set for deduplication. Agents that cached the old zero values should call `ci_project_stats` again to get accurate counts.

> **Note**: The unified upgrade/restart banner consolidates two previously overlapping UI states — `update_available` (version mismatch requiring daemon restart) and `upgrade_needed` (schema/config migrations requiring `oak upgrade`) — into a single banner component with distinct messaging for each state.

> **Note**: The shared `.agents/skills/` directory is the new canonical location for skills shared across multiple agents. Per-agent skill copies are no longer installed during `oak upgrade`; agents now resolve skills from the shared directory at runtime.

> **Note**: The power management state machine for the daemon UI introduces a `usePowerState` hook that centralizes polling intervals. Components that previously polled at fixed intervals now derive their polling rate from the shared power state, reducing CPU and network overhead during idle and sleep states.

> **Gotcha**: Governance hook event names use different casing across agents — Claude Code sends `PreToolUse` (PascalCase), but constants may be defined as `pre-tool-use` (kebab-case). The governance engine now normalizes all event names with `.lower().replace("-", "").replace("_", "")` to handle all variants.

> **Gotcha**: Session summaries were previously stored as `memory_observations` with `memory_type='session_summary'`. After the v5→v6 migration, they live in `sessions.summary`. Backup restore includes a backfill function (`_backfill_session_summaries_from_observations`) to handle legacy backup files that still use the old format.

> **Gotcha**: Governance audit events are stored in `governance_audit_events` and are now included in team backups. If restoring a backup from before governance was implemented, the audit table will be empty but functional.

> **Gotcha**: SQLite's VACUUM command cannot run within a transaction context — attempting to do so raises `OperationalError: cannot VACUUM from within a transaction`. DevTools maintenance operations now explicitly close any active transaction before running VACUUM.

> **Gotcha**: ChromaDB delete operations can fail silently and leave orphaned entries. The new "Clear Orphan Entries" button in DevTools identifies embeddings that lack corresponding SQLite records and removes them with retry logic to handle transient failures.

> **Gotcha**: The version mismatch detection writes a stamp file (`.oak/ci/cli_version`) only when the CLI runs, so it adds no overhead to normal operation. However, the `restartDaemon` API call must be awaited before updating the UI — otherwise stale data may be displayed.

> **Gotcha**: When automatic built-in task installation is disabled, any missing built-in task files will cause runtime errors if agents reference them. Ensure required tasks are present in `oak/agents/` before running the pipeline, or rely on the registry's built-in loader.

> **Gotcha**: The project name in the browser tab is sourced from `window.projectName` injected by the server. If this variable is missing or undefined, the title defaults to just the static suffix.

> **Gotcha**: After the `hooks-local-only` migration, hook config files (e.g., `.cursor/hooks.json`, `.windsurf/hooks.json`) are gitignored and exist only on machines with Oak installed. Hooks already degrade gracefully when files are absent, so contributors without Oak are unaffected — but developers must run `oak upgrade` to regenerate local hook files after a fresh clone.

> **Gotcha**: The daemon self-restart route must not use `sys.executable` because Homebrew upgrades delete the old Cellar path. If you see `FileNotFoundError` during restart, verify that the `oak` binary on `$PATH` points to the current version (`which oak`).

> **Gotcha**: The "Compact All" button in DevTools deletes the ChromaDB collection, but ChromaDB holds file locks that persist until the process exits. Without a daemon restart, subsequent re-indexing fails with database lock errors. The fix triggers an automatic restart after deletion to cleanly reopen the database.

> **Gotcha**: VS Code Copilot hook crashes were caused by schema validation running before hook formatting centralization. If you see hook errors after an upgrade, run `oak upgrade` to regenerate hook configurations with the corrected schema handling.

> **Gotcha**: Inline plan detection uses heuristic response patterns (e.g., numbered steps, "Implementation Plan" headers). False positives are possible for assistant responses that resemble plans but aren't. The detector favors recall over precision — plans are better captured twice than missed.

> **Gotcha**: Power state idle detection requires a fallback to `start_time` when `last_hook_activity` is None. Without this, the daemon stays in ACTIVE state forever if no hooks fire after startup (e.g., daemon starts and user walks away). The fix uses `last_activity = daemon_state.last_hook_activity or daemon_state.start_time`.

> **Gotcha**: Resolution events are stored separately from observations in the `resolution_events` table. When backing up/restoring, both tables must be synchronized — if resolution events are missing, observations may incorrectly appear as unresolved on the target machine.

> **Gotcha**: Machine-specific source ID filters in background processing queries prevent cross-machine data leakage but require the `source_machine_id` column to be populated. Observations created before this column existed will have NULL source IDs and may be filtered out unexpectedly.

> **Gotcha**: The `store_resolution_event` helper requires the observation ID and action status to be passed explicitly. Forgetting to provide these arguments leads to silent failures or incorrect event logging.

> **Gotcha**: Observation lifecycle status defaults to `active`. When querying memories via `ci_memories` or `ci_search`, use `status=active` for current knowledge and `include_resolved=true` only for historical documentation (e.g., changelogs). Resolved observations represent what *was* true, not what *is* true.

> **Gotcha**: Session origin types (`planning`, `investigation`, `implementation`, `mixed`) are inferred from file changes and code patterns. Planning-originated observations are more likely to become stale after implementation work completes — the auto-resolve system uses semantic similarity to detect when newer observations supersede older ones.

> **Gotcha**: The batch processing size (now 50 items per cycle) is a magic number that was refactored into a configurable constant. If processing appears slow, check that the batch size hasn't been inadvertently reduced, and ensure parallel processing is enabled to avoid database locking issues.

> **Gotcha**: Ollama often uses a smaller default context window than LM Studio for the same model, causing output format instructions at the end of long prompts to be truncated. This leads models to return JSON (e.g., `{"summary": [...]}`) instead of plain text. The `_unwrap_json_summary()` function in `summaries.py` handles this defensively.

> **Gotcha**: Cloud relay WebSocket connections require an active worker deployment to validate. The connection handler checks for worker availability before establishing the WebSocket, and errors are shown only when new actual errors occur rather than showing transient states.

> **Gotcha**: The `title_manually_edited` flag prevents LLM-generated titles from overwriting user edits. However, if a user clears the title field and saves, the flag remains set — the title won't auto-regenerate until the flag is explicitly cleared.

> **Gotcha**: Custom domain provisioning for Cloud Relay requires the domain zone to reside in the user's Cloudflare account. If the zone is managed elsewhere, automatic DNS/SSL provisioning will fail silently and the worker will fall back to the default `workers.dev` URL.

> **Gotcha**: UI state for saved custom domains is not persisted across page refreshes — users may need to re-save the domain after refreshing the Cloud Relay settings page.

> **Gotcha**: Content-hash deduplication compares the full text of observations before insertion. Two observations with identical content but different metadata (e.g., different `session_id` or `memory_type`) are treated as duplicates — only the first is stored. If you need to record the same insight across multiple sessions, vary the observation text slightly or rely on session-level attribution via the `session_id` metadata.

> **Gotcha**: Session-linking microsecond precision — `SESSION_LINK_IMMEDIATE_GAP_SECONDS` and `SESSION_LINK_STALE_GAP_SECONDS` thresholds are defined in whole seconds, but timestamp comparisons include microseconds. Sessions that end within the same second as a new one starts may be misclassified as stale or immediate depending on microsecond ordering. This is most visible under rapid "clear context and continue" operations.

> **Gotcha**: The restore API does not automatically generate governance audit entries for restored data. If your workflow requires a full audit trail across restores, trigger audit logging manually after a successful restore.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-10

### Added

- Homebrew tap (`goondocks-co/oak`) for macOS installation with auto-generated formula and CI workflow to keep the formula in sync with PyPI releases — [Add Homebrew tap for oak‑ci with auto‑generated formula and CI sync](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/f39cb49c-b959-41e1-b7d3-321f8d8f8475)
- OAK-managed file tracking in `oak remove` — agent task YAMLs and `daemon.port` are now recorded via `StateService` and automatically cleaned up on removal, while preserving user content (`constitution.md`, RFCs, plans) and backup history — [Implement OAK‑managed file cleanup in oak remove](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/c8dc1dcb-4e07-4e0b-bcd7-261cf61b714b)

### Fixed

- Fix `oak/daemon.port` not created on fresh installs when no git remote is defined, causing daemon startup failures — [Fix daemon port creation and enforce Python version requirement](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/676be56f-00cf-4b96-8b63-539622365341)
- Fix `oak remove` leaving behind OAK-generated agent task files and `daemon.port`, requiring manual cleanup — [Fix oak remove to delete agent task files and daemon port](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/3a41f8b7-02fd-4d2d-950e-5b3cde0d6bd1)
- Enforce Python version requirement in install script and documentation — users installing via `pipx` or `uv` must now specify `--python` to avoid Homebrew defaulting to an unsupported interpreter (e.g., 3.14) — [Fix daemon port creation and enforce Python version requirement](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/676be56f-00cf-4b96-8b63-539622365341)

### Notes

> **Gotcha**: Homebrew formula for oak-ci uses `python -m venv` directly (not `virtualenv_create`) because Homebrew's helper passes `--without-pip`. Key details: (1) `venv.pip_install` uses `--no-deps` so deps won't install — the formula uses `system libexec/"bin/pip", "install"` instead, (2) `homebrew-pypi-poet` requires `setuptools<81` on Python 3.13, (3) `bin.install_symlink libexec/"bin/oak"` is needed to expose the binary.

> **Gotcha**: The removal logic now distinguishes between OAK-managed files (agent task YAMLs, `daemon.port`) and user-generated content. If custom files are placed in `oak/agents/` with names matching the `agent-*.yaml` pattern, they may be incorrectly treated as OAK-managed and removed during `oak remove`.

> **Gotcha**: If the `--python` flag is omitted when installing with `pipx` or `uv`, Oak may be installed against an unintended Python interpreter (e.g., Homebrew's Python 3.14), leading to runtime errors from incompatible dependencies like `chromadb` and `pydantic`.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-09

### Added

- Published `oak-ci` package to PyPI (v1.0.2) with cross-platform install script supporting macOS, Linux, and Windows PATH detection — [Publish oak-ci 1.0.2 and fix install script](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/44aa9400-db40-4db8-971e-5991cf0434b4)

### Improved

- Daemon UI TaskList CPU usage reduced from ~10% to ~2% idle via `React.memo`, `useCallback`, debounced search, and batched API requests — [Refactor TaskList to Reduce CPU Usage in Oak Daemon UI](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/cdd818d1-75e4-48ee-9d48-2f59af2dfe53)
- Test suite audited: stale imports removed, test-to-source mapping updated, orphan tests flagged — [Debug test suite audit and stale import cleanup](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/c89831a0-e4af-4f79-b8fb-99e6ccea904b)

### Notes

> **Gotcha**: `.oak/state.yaml` tracks applied migration names. If migrations are removed from the codebase but their names remain in state.yaml, the migration runner may attempt to reference non-existent modules, causing `ImportError` or silent failures during startup. After a clean release, ensure state.yaml is reset or excluded from version control.

> **Gotcha**: The install script must handle both user-local and system installations. On macOS, `~/.local/bin` may not be on PATH by default — the installer now appends it to the appropriate shell profile (`.zshrc`, `.bash_profile`), but users with custom shell setups should verify manually.

> **Gotcha**: GitHub issue templates must be placed in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` with the `.yml` extension. A missing or misnamed file will silently not appear in the issue creation UI.

## [Previous] - pre-1.0.2

### Added

### Improved

- Session URLs in changelog now link directly to daemon UI for better traceability
- Executor now uses runtime lookup of daemon port for greater deployment flexibility
- Hook timeout increased to reduce flaky failures during heavy local LLM workloads
- Session end hook now auto-generates pending titles from session summary for better discoverability
- Codex VS Code extension OTel configuration validated — project-local `.codex/config.toml` is syntactically correct but extension only reads global config — [Configure OTel settings for Codex VS Code extension](http://localhost:38388/activity/sessions/019c3130-4d28-7772-ab84-cbac66f0947a)

### Notes

> **Gotcha**: The Codex VS Code extension only reads the global `codex.toml` for OTel settings — project-local `.codex/config.toml` is ignored by the extension. Place OTel configuration in the global file if targeting the extension.

> **Gotcha**: Backup directory paths configured via `OAK_CI_BACKUP_DIR` must be absolute. Relative paths silently resolve to cwd, which can produce unexpected file locations if the process changes directories.

> **Gotcha**: The `uv tool install` commands in `feature_service.py` and `language_service.py` previously destroyed editable installs. If you experience stale daemon assets or `Path(__file__)` resolving to `site-packages`, verify with `oak --python-path -c "import open_agent_kit; print(open_agent_kit.__file__)"` — the path must contain your source tree.

> **Gotcha**: Agent YAML files must be placed in `oak/agents` with the exact same filename as the built-in version; otherwise the registry will not find them and the default task will be used. A missing or renamed file silently falls back to the core definition.

> **Gotcha**: The daemon port file is now expected at `oak/` instead of `oak/ci/`. Documentation or tooling referencing the old path will fail to load runtime configuration.

> **Gotcha**: The `UpgradeService` performs a dry-run check first. Running `oak upgrade` compares template files against the latest version and reports "already up to date" if no differences are found. It does **not** trigger the asset build step — run `oak build` explicitly after modifying skills.

> **Gotcha**: The next auto-backup time is calculated as `last_backup + interval`. If no previous backup exists, an immediate backup is scheduled. This approach avoids cron complexity but may drift if backups take longer than expected.

> **Gotcha**: Astro's `output: 'static'` mode triggers prerendering for all routes without dynamic data. Ensure the docs site has no server-only routes before enabling this optimization.
