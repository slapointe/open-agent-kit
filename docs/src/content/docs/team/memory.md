The core power of OAK is its ability to learn and remember. This page explains how the **Memory Engine** works and how it integrates with your existing tools.

## The Memory Lifecycle

1. **Observation**: An event occurs (a bug is fixed, a decision is made)
2. **Capture**: The event is captured either automatically via hooks or manually through the dashboard
3. **Storage**: The observation is stored in the Activity Log (SQLite) and embedded into the Vector Store (ChromaDB)
4. **Recall**: When a future task matches the semantic context of the memory, it is proactively retrieved and injected into the agent's prompt
5. **Resolution**: When the observation is no longer relevant (the bug was fixed, the gotcha was addressed), it is marked as resolved or superseded — either automatically or by an agent

## Memory Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `gotcha` | Non-obvious behaviors or warnings | "The API requires basic auth, not bearer token." |
| `decision` | Architectural or design choices | "We use polling instead of websockets for stability." |
| `bug_fix` | Solutions to specific errors | "Fixed race condition in transaction handler." |
| `discovery` | Facts learned about the codebase | "The user table is sharded by region." |
| `trade_off` | Trade-offs made and their rationale | "Sacrificed write throughput for read latency." |
| `session_summary` | High-level summary of a coding session | "Implemented user login flow." |

## Observation Status

Every observation has a lifecycle `status`:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `active` | Current and relevant. This is the default for all new observations. Active observations are injected into agent context and returned by search. |
| `resolved` | The issue was addressed in a later session. Resolved observations are hidden from default search results but preserved for historical context. |
| `superseded` | Replaced by a newer, more accurate observation. The `superseded_by` field links to the replacement. |

Only **active** observations are injected into agent context and returned by default searches. Use `include_resolved=true` in search queries or the `--include-resolved` CLI flag to see resolved/superseded observations.

## Session Origin Types

Observations are tagged with the type of session that created them:

| Origin Type | Description | Importance Cap |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `planning` | Planning-phase session (mostly reads, few edits) | Capped at 5 |
| `investigation` | Exploration/debugging session (many reads, minimal edits) | Capped at 5 |
| `implementation` | Active coding session (significant file modifications) | No cap |
| `mixed` | Combined activity patterns | No cap |

Session origin type is **computed deterministically** from read/edit ratios in the session stats — no LLM involved. Planning and investigation observations are automatically capped at importance 5 because they tend to describe temporary state ("this file is too long") rather than permanent insights.

## Auto-Resolve (Automatic Supersession)

When a new observation is stored — whether extracted automatically from a session or stored explicitly via `oak_remember` — the system checks for older observations it might replace.

### How it works

1. **Search**: ChromaDB is queried for the top 5 semantically similar **active** observations of the **same memory type** (e.g., gotcha→gotcha, not gotcha→discovery)
2. **Threshold check**: Each candidate is compared against a similarity threshold:
   - **Same file/context** (both observations reference the same file path) → **0.85** cosine similarity
   - **No shared context** → **0.92** (stricter to avoid false positives)
3. **Supersede**: Observations above the threshold are marked `superseded` with a link back to the new observation via `superseded_by`
4. **Dual write**: Both SQLite (source of truth) and ChromaDB (search index) are updated

### What determines similarity?

Similarity scores come from **cosine distance** between embedding vectors in ChromaDB. The configured embedding model (e.g., `nomic-embed-text`) converts observation text into high-dimensional vectors. A better embedding model produces more semantically meaningful similarity scores.

### What's skipped

- `session_summary` observations are never auto-resolved (they use deterministic IDs and upsert naturally)
- Same-session observations are skipped (can't supersede yourself)
- Observations below the threshold are left alone — false positives are worse than missed resolutions

### Example

A planning session produces: *"constants.ts is 800 lines and should be split into domain modules"* (`gotcha`, context: `src/lib/constants.ts`).

A later implementation session completes the refactoring. The LLM extracts: *"constants.ts was refactored into domain modules under lib/constants/"* (`gotcha`, context: `src/lib/constants.ts`).

Same type (`gotcha`), same file context, similarity well above 0.85 → the old observation is automatically superseded. Future agents no longer see the stale "should be split" advice.

## Manual Resolution

Agents can also resolve observations explicitly when they complete work that addresses a known issue:

- **MCP tool**: `oak_resolve_memory(id="<observation-id>", status="resolved")`
- **CLI**: `oak ci resolve <observation-id>`
- **Bulk by session**: `oak ci resolve --session <session-id>`

Observation IDs are included in injected context and search results, so agents have what they need to call `oak_resolve_memory` without extra lookups.

## Auto-Capture Hooks

OAK CI **automatically installs** hooks into supported agents during `oak init`. No manual configuration is required.

### Supported Integrations

| Agent | Capability | Integration Method |
|-------|------------|--------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Full (Input/Output Analysis) | `settings.json` hook scripts (auto-synced) |
| **Codex CLI** | Partial (Output Analysis) | OTLP log events & Notify |
| **Cursor** | Full (Input/Output Analysis) | `.cursor/hooks.json` (auto-synced) |
| **Gemini CLI** | Full (Input/Output Analysis) | `settings.json` hook scripts (auto-synced) |
| **OpenCode** | Partial (Output Analysis) | TypeScript plugin (auto-installed) |
| **VS Code Copilot** | Full (Input/Output Analysis) | `.github/hooks/hooks.json` (auto-synced) |
| **Windsurf** | Partial (Output Analysis) | `.windsurf/hooks.json` (auto-synced) |
| **MCP Agents** | Tools + Context | Auto-registered MCP Server |

### Post-Tool Analysis
When using fully supported agents (Claude/Gemini), the CI daemon analyzes every tool output (e.g., `Bash`, `Edit`, `Write`).

- **Error Detection**: If a command fails, it records the error as a `gotcha`
- **Fix Detection**: If you `Edit` a file after an error, it correlates the fix with the error and stores a `bug_fix`
- **Summarization**: At the end of a session, a local LLM summarizes the work and updates the project memory

## Managing Memories

**The dashboard is the primary way to manage memories.** Open the **Activity > Memories** tab to:

- **Browse** all stored memories by type, date, status, or content
- **Search** memories using natural language queries
- **Archive** memories to hide them from active lists (reversible)
- **Delete** memories that are outdated or incorrect

Agents can also store memories programmatically using the MCP tools. See [MCP Tools](/team/mcp/) for details on `oak_remember` and `oak_resolve_memory`.

## Rebuilding Memory Embeddings

If you change embedding models, rebuild the memory index from the dashboard's **[DevTools](/team/devtools/)** page — click **Rebuild Memories** to re-embed all observations from SQLite into ChromaDB.

## Agent Hooks API

If you are building your own tools or agent integrations, you can hit the hook endpoints directly:

```http
POST /api/oak/ci/hooks/session/start
{
  "agent": "custom-agent",
  "project_path": "/path/to/project"
}
```

See the [API Reference](/team/developer-api/) for more details.
