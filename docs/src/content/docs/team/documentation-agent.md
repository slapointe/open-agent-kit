title: Documentation Agent
description: An autonomous agent that maintains project documentation using team intelligence.
---

The Documentation Agent is an autonomous AI agent that maintains project documentation by analyzing your code, session history, and CI memories. It runs locally within OAK's daemon, powered by the Claude Agent SDK.

Unlike external coding agents that you interact with directly, the Documentation Agent works autonomously — you give it a task, and it explores your codebase, gathers context from CI, and writes or updates documentation on its own.

## How It Works

The agent has access to both your filesystem (read/write markdown files) and CI's full knowledge base:

| CI Tool | What the agent uses it for |
|---------|---------------------------|
| `ci_search` | Semantic search across code, memories, and plans |
| `ci_memories` | Filter observations by type (gotcha, decision, discovery, bug_fix, trade_off) |
| `ci_sessions` | Access recent coding sessions with summaries |
| `ci_project_stats` | Get codebase structure and statistics |

For every task, the agent follows a consistent workflow:

1. **Gather context** — Query CI for relevant plans, code, memories, and sessions
2. **Extract insights** — Identify gotchas to surface as warnings, decisions to explain "why", recent changes to document
3. **Write documentation** — Create CI-enriched docs with code references and source links
4. **Verify claims** — Confirm code examples exist, configuration options match reality, file paths are valid

## Built-in Tasks

OAK ships four built-in tasks that cover the most common documentation needs. Run them from the Agents page in the dashboard, or trigger them via the API.

### Root Documentation

Maintains the four root-level files visitors see first: `README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `SECURITY.md`. One task (not four) because these files cross-reference each other — consistent linking requires a single pass.

**What it does:**
- Reads all four files, then makes targeted updates to each
- Explores entry points, CLI, API, and features
- Enriches each file differently based on its role (see below)
- Verifies cross-links between files and confirms code examples exist

**Each file has a distinct purpose and length budget:**

| File | Purpose | Lines | CI Enrichment |
|------|---------|-------|---------------|
| `README.md` | Landing page — tagline, quick install, one example, links out | 60–100 | Minimal (project stats to validate feature claims) |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | Hands-on guide — multiple install methods, walkthrough, config, troubleshooting | 150–250 | Heavy (gotcha memories → troubleshooting section) |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contributor onboarding — dev setup, quality gate, PR workflow | 80–120 | Light (gotchas about dev environment) |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security policy — vulnerability reporting, supported versions | 40–80 | None (stable policy document) |

**CI queries:** Project stats, recent sessions, gotchas (×15), discoveries (×10), bug fixes (×5).

### Feature Documentation

Discovers and documents all features in your project. Finds undocumented features, updates outdated docs, and creates CI-enriched feature documentation.

**What it does:**
- Discovers features via glob patterns, manifests, and CI search
- Checks existing docs to identify gaps and stale content
- For each undocumented feature: explores implementation, gathers plans/decisions/gotchas, writes documentation
- Includes "Known Issues & Gotchas" and "Design Decisions" sections sourced directly from CI memories

**CI queries:** Feature implementations, design plans, decisions, gotchas, discoveries, and recent sessions.

### Changelog Generator

Generates changelog entries from CI session history. Can be scheduled to run weekly or monthly.

**What it does:**
- Reads existing `CHANGELOG.md` for format and last entry date
- Gathers session history since the last entry
- Categorizes changes: Added, Changed, Fixed, Deprecated, Removed, Security
- Enriches with gotchas as notes and decisions for context
- Links each entry back to the originating session

**Output format:** [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) — entries link to session titles in the dashboard.

### Architecture Documentation

Documents your project's architecture by exploring the codebase structure and enriching it with CI decisions and trade-offs. Creates ADR (Architecture Decision Record) files.

**What it does:**
- Checks for existing architecture docs (never overwrites historical ADRs)
- Explores directory structure, key abstractions, dependencies, and patterns
- Gathers the "why" from CI — decisions, trade-offs, gotchas, plans
- Creates new ADRs for undocumented decisions
- Updates the architecture overview if the structure changed

**CI queries:** Decisions and trade-offs (required), plans, gotchas, project stats, and recent sessions.

## Output Location

Generated documentation is written to `oak/docs/` (git-tracked), with two exceptions:

| Task | Output |
|------|--------|
| Root Documentation | `README.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md` (project root) |
| Changelog Generator | `CHANGELOG.md` (project root) |
| Feature Documentation | `oak/docs/` |
| Architecture Documentation | `oak/docs/` |

Custom tasks default to `oak/docs/` unless their `maintained_files` specify a different path.

## Running Tasks

1. Navigate to the **Agents** page in the dashboard
2. Select a task from the task list
3. Click **Run** to start the agent
4. Watch progress in real time — output streams as the agent works
5. View completed runs in the **Run History** section

### Run History

Every agent run is recorded with:
- **Status** — Running, completed, failed, or cancelled
- **Output** — Full agent output including any generated files
- **Timing** — Start time, duration, and token usage
- **Cancellation** — Cancel a running agent at any time

## Scheduling

Tasks can be scheduled to run automatically using cron expressions. Manage schedules from the Agents page in the dashboard.

**Common schedules:**

| Cron | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| `0 9 * * MON` | Weekly on Monday at 9 AM |
| `0 0 * * *` | Daily at midnight |
| `0 0 1 * *` | Monthly on the 1st |
| `0 */6 * * *` | Every 6 hours |

## Custom Tasks

You can create custom tasks that the Documentation Agent will automatically pick up. Custom tasks live in `oak/agents/` (git-tracked) and use the same YAML format as built-in tasks. Built-in tasks are read from the OAK package itself — they are not copied into your project.

### Task File Format

```yaml
name: my-task                           # Lowercase with hyphens

### Creating a Custom Task

1. Create a YAML file in `oak/agents/`:

```bash
ls oak/agents/   # Verify directory exists
```

2. Write your task definition following the schema above.

3. The daemon automatically discovers the new task — no restart needed.

:::tip
You can also create tasks from the dashboard. Click **Create Task** on the Agents page to start from a built-in template, then customize it.

### Overriding Built-in Tasks

To customize a built-in task, create a file in `oak/agents/` with the same `name` as the built-in task. Your custom version takes precedence.

For example, to customize the root documentation task:

```yaml
# oak/agents/root-docs.yaml
name: root-docs                         # Same name = overrides built-in
display_name: "Custom Root Docs"
agent_type: documentation
description: "Root docs with project-specific instructions"

default_task: |
  Update root documentation with focus on:
  1. README.md — keep under 80 lines, update install example
  2. QUICKSTART.md — add troubleshooting for Docker setup
  3. CONTRIBUTING.md — add section about database migrations
  4. SECURITY.md — no changes needed

execution:
  timeout_seconds: 480
  max_turns: 80
  permission_mode: acceptEdits

maintained_files:
  - path: "{project_root}/README.md"
    purpose: "Landing page"
  - path: "{project_root}/QUICKSTART.md"
    purpose: "Getting started guide"
    auto_create: true
  - path: "{project_root}/CONTRIBUTING.md"
    purpose: "Contributor onboarding"
    auto_create: true
  - path: "{project_root}/SECURITY.md"
    purpose: "Security policy"
    auto_create: true

ci_queries:
  discovery:
    - tool: ci_sessions
      limit: 15
      include_summary: true
      purpose: "Recent changes"
    - tool: ci_project_stats
      purpose: "Project overview"
  context:
    - tool: ci_memories
      filter: gotcha
      limit: 15
      purpose: "Troubleshooting for QUICKSTART"

schedule:
  cron: "0 9 * * MON"
  description: "Weekly Monday morning"

## Provider Configuration

The Documentation Agent uses the shared OAK Agents provider configured in **Agents page → Settings** (`/agents/settings`).

See [OAK Agents](/team/agents/#provider-configuration) for supported providers and setup details.

## Security

The Documentation Agent operates within strict boundaries:

**Allowed file access:**
- `oak/docs/**`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/**`, and any `*.md` file

**Blocked file access:**
- `.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.crt`, `**/credentials*`, `**/secrets*`

**Allowed tools:**
- `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `Glob`, `Grep` (filesystem)
- `ci_search`, `ci_memories`, `ci_sessions`, `ci_project_stats` (CI data)

**Blocked tools:**
- `Bash` (no shell access)
