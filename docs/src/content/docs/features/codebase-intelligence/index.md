**Codebase Intelligence (CI)** captures the complete development story behind AI-written code. Every plan, decision, gotcha, and trade-off is recorded as your agents work — creating a semantically rich history that goes far beyond what git blame or commit messages could ever tell you.

## The Problem

When AI agents build your software, the most valuable part of the process isn't the code — it's the *reasoning*. Why was this approach chosen over alternatives? What gotchas were discovered? What architectural trade-offs were made? All of that context lives in agent sessions that vanish when the conversation ends.

Git captures *what* changed. OAK captures *why*, *how*, and *what was learned along the way*.

## How CI Works

Codebase Intelligence runs as a lightweight local daemon that provides four interconnected capabilities:

### 1. The Development Record
CI automatically captures the full lifecycle of every agent session — prompts, tool executions, plans, AI summaries, and outcomes. In the background, an LLM classifies these activities and extracts observations: gotchas, decisions, discoveries, bug fixes, and trade-offs. These become your project's persistent memory.

- **Gotchas**: "The auth module requires Redis to be running."
- **Decisions**: "We chose SQLite over Postgres for simplicity."
- **Trade-offs**: "Sacrificed write throughput for read latency in the caching layer."

This is the development context that no one writes down but everyone wishes they had six months later.

### 2. Semantic Code Search
The daemon maintains a real-time vector index of your codebase using AST-aware chunking (via tree-sitter across 13 languages). Agents find code by *concept* rather than keyword — "where is the authentication middleware?" finds the right file even if it's named differently, based on its semantic function.

### 3. Proactive Context Injection
CI doesn't wait for you to ask. It integrates directly with your agent's workflow through hooks:
- **Session Start**: Injects project context and relevant memories before the agent begins.
- **Pre-Prompt**: Surfaces related code and past learnings before each prompt.
- **Post-Tool**: Analyzes file operations to provide file-specific memories and capture new activities.
- **Session End**: Summarizes the entire session and extracts observations for long-term memory.

The result: agents that remember what your team has learned, across every session and every engineer.

### 4. Agent Skills
OAK extends your agent's capabilities through [Skills](/open-agent-kit/agents/skills/) — slash commands that leverage CI's knowledge base for tasks like finding related code, analyzing change impacts, creating RFCs, and establishing project standards.

## The Dashboard

After setup, **the [Dashboard](/open-agent-kit/features/codebase-intelligence/dashboard/) is your primary interface**. Use it to search your codebase, browse agent sessions, manage memories, configure settings, and more — all from your browser.

The **[ACP Server](/open-agent-kit/features/codebase-intelligence/acp/)** integration lets ACP-compatible editors (like Zed) use OAK as a first-class coding agent — with CI built in rather than bolted on via hooks.

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Context Injection | Activity Capture | Integration Method |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| **Claude Code** | Session + Prompt + Post-tool | Yes | `settings.json` hooks |
| **Gemini CLI** | Session + Prompt + Post-tool | Yes | `settings.json` hooks |
| **Cursor** | Session + Prompt + Post-tool | Yes | `.cursor/hooks.json` |
| **OpenCode** | Session + Prompt + Post-tool | Yes | TypeScript plugin (`oak-ci.ts`) |
| **VS Code Copilot** | Session + Prompt + Post-tool | Yes | `.github/hooks/hooks.json` |
| **Windsurf** | Prompt only | Yes | `.windsurf/hooks.json` |
| **Codex CLI** | Via OpenTelemetry | Yes | OTLP log events & Notify |

| **OAK (ACP)** | Built-in (full) | Yes | ACP server (direct integration) |

**Context injection** is what makes CI proactive — it automatically surfaces relevant memories and code search results into your agent's context. Agents with **Session + Prompt + Post-tool** injection get the richest experience: context at session start, before each prompt, and after file operations. Agents with **Prompt only** receive context before each prompt but not at session start.

**OAK via ACP** is the deepest integration — CI is built into every response, not injected through hooks. See the [ACP documentation](/open-agent-kit/features/codebase-intelligence/acp/) for details.
