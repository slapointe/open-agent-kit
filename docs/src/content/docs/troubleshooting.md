## ModuleNotFoundError after upgrade

If you see `ModuleNotFoundError` for packages like `httpx` after upgrading:

```bash
# Homebrew (handles dependencies automatically)
brew reinstall oak-ci

# Or with pipx (requires Python 3.12 or 3.13)
pipx reinstall oak-ci

# Or with uv
uv tool install --force oak-ci --python python3.13
```

This can happen when new dependencies are added to the package but the global installation wasn't updated.

## Command not found: oak

**Using pipx or uv:**

```bash
# Ensure tools are in your PATH
# Add to ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or equivalent:
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Then reload your shell:
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

**Using pip:**

```bash
# Check if pip's script directory is in PATH
python3 -m pip show oak-ci

# If installed with --user flag, add to PATH:
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## Daemon version mismatch after upgrade

After upgrading OAK, the running daemon may still be on the old version. OAK detects this automatically:

- **In the CLI**: `oak team start` or `oak team status` will display a hint if the daemon version doesn't match the installed CLI version.
- **In the Dashboard**: A banner appears at the top of the page showing the running and installed versions, with a **Restart** button to apply the update.

To resolve manually:

```bash
oak team restart     # Restart the daemon with the new version
oak ci sync          # Or run sync, which also restarts and applies migrations
```

:::tip
After running `oak upgrade`, the daemon will detect the version mismatch and prompt you to restart — either via the CLI hint or the dashboard banner.

## Something feels broken

`oak init` is idempotent and safe to re-run. It's the first thing to try when something isn't working:

```bash
oak init          # Re-run initialization to repair setup
```

For CI-specific issues after an upgrade, `oak upgrade` followed by `oak ci sync` is the standard healing path:

```bash
oak upgrade       # Update templates and agent commands
oak ci sync       # Sync daemon, apply migrations, re-index if needed
```

## Changes not taking effect (editable install)

If you're developing OAK and changes aren't reflected:

**For Python code changes:** They should work immediately with editable mode.

**For dependency or entry point changes:**

```bash
make setup
```

## Python 3.14+ errors (chromadb / pydantic)

OAK requires **Python 3.12 or 3.13**. Python 3.14 is not yet supported due to dependency incompatibilities (notably chromadb and pydantic v1).

The simplest fix on macOS is to use the Homebrew formula, which pins Python 3.13 automatically:

```bash
brew install goondocks-co/oak/oak-ci
```

Or reinstall with an explicit interpreter:

```bash
# Check your default version
python3 --version

# Reinstall with a supported version
pipx install oak-ci --python python3.13 --force

# Or with uv
uv tool install oak-ci --python python3.13 --force
```

If you don't have 3.13 installed:

```bash
# macOS
brew install python@3.13

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install python3.13
```

## Permission denied errors

**Using pipx or uv:** Should work without sudo (installs to `~/.local`).

**Using pip:** Don't use sudo with pip — use the `--user` flag:

```bash
pip install --user oak-ci
```

## .oak directory not found

Run `oak init` first to initialize the project.

## AI agent commands not showing up

```bash
# Re-run init to install agent commands
oak init --agent claude
```

Agent commands are installed in their native directories (`.claude/commands/`, `.github/agents/`, etc.).

## Daemon won't start

Check if the daemon is already running:

```bash
oak team status
```

If the port is in use or the daemon is in a bad state:

```bash
oak team stop      # Stop any existing daemon
oak team start     # Start fresh
```

## Uninstallation

```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew uninstall oak-ci

# Using pipx
pipx uninstall oak-ci

# Using uv
uv tool uninstall oak-ci

# Using pip
pip uninstall oak-ci
```

This removes the CLI tool but does not delete project files created by `oak init`. To clean up a project, run `oak remove`.
