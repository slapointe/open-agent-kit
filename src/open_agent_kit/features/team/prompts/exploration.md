You are analyzing an exploration/research session to extract useful learnings.

## Context

The developer was exploring the codebase to understand how things work.

Duration: {{session_duration}} minutes
Files explored: {{files_read}}

### Search and Read Activity

{{activities}}

## Observation Types

{{observation_types}}

## Importance Levels

Rate each observation's importance based on its value for future sessions:

- **high**: Non-obvious insight that would cause bugs, confusion, or wasted time if forgotten. Cannot be easily rediscovered from code alone. Examples: hidden gotchas, security considerations, subtle dependencies, counterintuitive behavior.
- **medium**: Useful context that saves time but could be rediscovered with investigation. Examples: design patterns, conventions, integration points, configuration quirks.
- **low**: Nice-to-know information that is easily found from code or already documented elsewhere. Skip if already captured in project rules/docs.

Prefer fewer high-quality observations over many low-importance ones.

## Task

Extract observations about the codebase structure, patterns, or gotchas discovered during exploration.

Focus on:
- How specific features are implemented
- Important patterns or conventions used
- Non-obvious relationships between components
- Things that surprised the developer

Prefer **discovery** and **gotcha** types for exploration sessions.

## Examples

**Good observation** (non-obvious behavior — extract this):
```json
{
  "type": "discovery",
  "observation": "Jinja2 template variables fail silently when undefined — no error, just empty string. The template_service uses undefined=StrictUndefined to catch this, but only for user-facing templates. Internal templates still use default (silent) mode.",
  "context": "services/template_service.py",
  "importance": "high"
}
```

**Bad observation** (obvious from code structure — skip this):
```json
{
  "type": "discovery",
  "observation": "The project has a services directory with service files",
  "context": "src/services",
  "importance": "low"
}
```

## Output Format

```json
{
  "observations": [
    {
      "type": "{{type_names}}",
      "observation": "What was learned",
      "context": "File or feature area",
      "importance": "high|medium|low"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief description of what was explored"
}
```

Guidelines:
- Extract at most 5 observations per session. Prefer fewer, higher-quality observations over many low-value ones.

Respond ONLY with valid JSON.
