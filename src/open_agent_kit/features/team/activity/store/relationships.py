"""Session relationship operations for activity store.

Functions for creating, retrieving, and managing many-to-many semantic
relationships between sessions. This complements the parent-child model
(designed for temporal continuity) with relationships that can span any time gap.

Use cases:
- Working on a feature a month ago and iterating on it now
- Related sessions working on the same component/concept
- User-driven linking of sessions that work on similar topics
