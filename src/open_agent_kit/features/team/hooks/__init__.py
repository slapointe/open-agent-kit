"""Hooks management for Team.

This module provides a Python-based API for installing and removing CI hooks
across different AI coding agents. Configuration is read from agent manifests,
making it portable and cross-platform.

Example usage:
    from open_agent_kit.features.team.hooks import (
        install_hooks,
        remove_hooks,
    )

    # Install for a single agent
    result = install_hooks(
        project_root=Path("/path/to/project"),
        agent="claude",
    )

    # Remove from a single agent
    result = remove_hooks(
        project_root=Path("/path/to/project"),
        agent="claude",
    )
