"""Tests for POST /api/self-restart route.

Tests cover:
- Returns restarting status
- Spawns /bin/sh subprocess (not sys.executable)
- Uses configured cli_command
- Uses default cli_command when not set
- Passes project_root as cwd
- Schedules SIGTERM shutdown task
- Error when no project_root
- Uses detach kwargs
- Returns 500 on subprocess spawn failure

Note: ``asyncio.create_task`` must NOT be mocked because the TestClient ASGI
transport depends on it internally.  We mock ``os.kill`` instead, which makes
the scheduled SIGTERM a no-op while still allowing us to verify the task was
created.
